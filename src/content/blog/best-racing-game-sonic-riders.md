## Kart Racers and Sonic

Up until the late 2010s, mascot kart racing games were pretty popular. They provide a simpler racing experience than realistic racing games and are thus easily marketed towards all ages. In these games, winning isn't solely reliant on skill - items like the infamous blue shell allow anyone to catch up if they fall behind, making this a very accessible sub-genre.

These qualities are what allowed Mario Kart to become the most popular racing game franchise of all time, and many developers attempted to chip away at its sales with their own spins on the genre. Crash Team Racing and ModNation Racers are games that are fondly remembered to this day for the changes they made to the formula.

Despite his main association being speed, the blue blur himself rarely gets mentioned when people talk about their favorite racing games. His most well-known racing spin-off is probably Sonic R, which is infamous for how bad it handled (and for its killer soundtrack). However, over the years Sonic Team have constantly been trying to dip their toes in the racing genre, even if their more recent attempts like Team Sonic Racing feel... painfully mediocre.

Putting Sonic and his friends in cars and calling it a day is a painfully boring solution. If they wanted to make a good racing game, they had to create something different. This line of thinking led them to create a game that *kind of* falls into the kart racer category but plays so uniquely that the term "kart" doesn't really fit here - especially since the game actually *doesn't* have karts in it, choosing to use hovercraft instead. Released in 2006, Sonic Riders is a game that's absolutely oozing with style, unique gameplay, clever details and is Sonic's best attempt at a racing game **to this day**. I'm willing say it is my favorite racing game of all time, even though it might seem like a failure if you only look at the ratings.

## What makes it so unique?

Most of the unique gameplay in Riders comes from replacing karts with *Extreme Gear* - hoverboards, hoverskates and hoverbikes. They are extremely fitting for the futuristic setting of Riders and fit well with Sonic's focus on being cool during the 2000s. All of them use air as fuel, which is a resource you actually have to manage throughout the race. If you run out of air, you're forced to run on foot until you regain some.

Presentation is definitely this game's strong suit - the soundtrack is very good, the UI color changes to match your character, the sound design is also great and the game actually introduces the first bird characters ever seen in a Sonic game!

Even something as simple as starting a race has a unique twist to it. Unlike most kart racers where you just press or hold a button at the right time, Riders has you starting on foot and you have to cross the starting line the moment the starting timer hits zero. This takes into account both the momentum and how long the starting line has been open, making something as simple as beginning a race a skill-based mechanic. If you try to cross it too early you will get shocked, placing you multiple seconds behind everyone.

## Managing Air

Air drains **passively** while the player is on their Extreme Gear. Certain actions like drifting and boosting will use up air much faster. A big component of racing in Riders is weaving in ways to replenish your air while also using a lot of it for boosts and drifts. This is done with a bunch of mechanics, most of which further tie into the unique gameplay of Extreme Gear.

**Tricks** — All stages in Riders feature multiple long jumps off of ramps. Players can do tricks by tilting the analog stick during these jumps. The amount of tricks you can do is determined by how much speed you had when you jumped, and how much you charged your jump. Once you land, you get a rank based on how many tricks you did, which also determines how big your speed and air bonus will be. If you land *during* a trick you get punished with a **C** rank, which comes with a speed penalty and almost no air reward.

**Type shortcuts** — Much like in Sonic Heroes, all characters have a Speed, Flight or Power type assigned to them. Apart from determining their strengths, types allow a given character to go through special shortcuts meant for only that type. Speed characters can grind on rails, Flight characters can fly off of special ramps and through flight rings, and Power characters can destroy certain stage props or hazards. All of these actions reward air and offer bonuses for chaining multiple of them together. Certain Extreme Gear even allow you to change a character's type.

**Turbulence** — This game's catch-up mechanic, they are trails of wind form behind racers riding at high speed. While riding a trail of turbulence, you go forward without consuming air and can move from side to side to accelerate. The edges of a turbulence trail sometimes allow for tricks, indicated by upwards-pointing arrows in such areas. Performing such tricks grants you a huge speed boost, and sometimes can put you on hidden paths, allowing you to catch up to others very quickly.

**Levelling up** — Stages have trails of rings in them, which function a lot like coins in Mario Kart or similar mechanics in other games. What makes Riders different is that instead of gradually increasing your stats as you collect more of them, you level up at 30 and 60 rings respectively. **Levelling up raises your max speed, max air, boost speed AND replenishes your air**, which makes levelling very important to winning a race.

**Stage gimmicks** - Every stage has some kind of gimmick that involves spinning the analog stick to generate air. All mods that I mention later in this post choose to automate this, making these gimmicks faster but also completely maxing out your air meter.

There are other ways of earning air like item boxes or pit stops, but those generally don't matter too much and pit stops are a last resort for when you're on foot.

## The Babylon Rogues

Like I mentioned before, Sonic Riders introduces a new set of characters - **The Babylon Rogues**. They are very experienced with Extreme Gear and serve as strong rivals to Sonic and his friends.

Team Babylon is specifically designed to contrast Team Sonic in their main colors, species and personalities. Sonic may be the fastest on the ground, but Jet is the fastest in the air, thus making birds an extremely fitting choice. Their sibling-like interactions and more aggressive, trashtalking personalities give them a very unique place in Sonic's character roster.

While the Rogues are portrayed as antagonists that can resort to some... *drastic measures*, they aren't necessarily evil like Eggman might be. By the end of the first game, the relationship between the two teams is more of a friendly rivalry which continues into the other Riders titles.
