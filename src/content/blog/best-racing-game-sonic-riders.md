*This post took me way too long and honestly I don’t wanna work on it anymore, so I won’t go into detail as much as I planned to initially. If you’d like to learn more than what I offer here, feel free to reach out to me!*

## Kart Racers and Sonic

Sonic the Hedgehog needs no introduction. Pretty much everyone knows him and would be able to correctly name **Speed** as his #1 defining trait. Sonic is cool, strong, a total showoff, even cocky, all because he is fast and knows how to use it to his advantage. Despite this, SEGA has struggled to create any good racing games involving him and his friends.

Their most notorious attempt would probably be **Sonic R** - a 1997 title for the SEGA Saturn and their third attempt at a Sonic racing game, this being the first one in 3D. Unlike most games in the genre, Sonic R chose to encourage jumping and exploration instead of focusing just on racing. As you can imagine, exploring the stage does not exactly go well with trying to finish the race as fast as possible.

Other unique traits of Sonic R include most characters being on foot, but controlling like any other kart racer (so A to accelerate, steering left/right with the stick etc), getting to collect all the chaos emeralds hidden throughout the different stages, as well as its absolutely **killer soundtrack**, which is guaranteed to *brighten up your day* (bad pun absolutely intended)

Despite being a pretty beloved game nowadays for it’s uniqueness, Sonic R definitely missed the mark back when it came out, leaving it with some pretty negative (but definitely valid) reviews. This is a trait that it shares with the very game that I’ll be spilling my brain juices about for most of this blog post - **Sonic Riders**.

## Too tricky?

I absolutely adore Sonic Riders. It came out back in… uuh… 2006…?

That’s right - Riders came out during one of the worst times for Sonic games. Even back then it was largely considered cool to hate on them, since they weren’t meeting people’s expectations as well as the adventure games did. Releasing during this time also didn’t do any favours to it’s graphics, as they had already started looking outdated, and the release of Sonic 06 only a few months later made that even more apparent.

You’re probably wondering what makes the game so special then. Like Sonic R, it had bad reviews, a lot of which were related to the core gameplay. Like Sonic R, these reviews are mostly valid criticisms that made the game a lot less enjoyable for many people. *Unlike* Sonic R, the root of the issue wasn’t necessarily with the gameplay itself, but rather with the fact that the game barely does anything to teach the player about it’s unique mechanics, of which there are a LOT. Despite this issue, many people *(including a young annie buh)* kept playing and eventually figured out how to play the game. Those that took the time to learn were met with a truly unique racing experience that hasn’t really been recreated to this day!

*But Amemobuh, Oracle of Knowledge, what are these unique mechanics you speak of?* Fear not my child, I shall explain shortly.

Riders follows many mascot kart racer conventions, you choose a character and something for them to… ride *(no not like that)*. Instead of using karts, Riders uses Extreme Gear - hoverboards, hoverskates and hoverbikes. A unique property of them is that they use **air** as fuel, which plays a role in actual gameplay.

### Getting Started

Before a race starts properly, all racers are lined up on foot in the starting area, with the starting line blocked off by an electrical grid. A countdown to lower the grid starts and you’re free to move around - your goal being to cross the starting line the moment the timer hits zero, with as much momentum as possible.

### Managing Air

Once the race starts, everyone goes on their EX-Gear. You accelerate automatically to your top speed, but the Gear also passively uses up Air, signified by the Air meter on the right of your screen.

![Sonic Riders Air Meter](<../../img/blog/riders/airmeter.png>)
<sub>The air meter, as shown in-game.<br>The blue bar represents how much air the player currently has.</sub>

Air is a replenishable resource that you’re encouraged to use as much as you comfortably can while also weaving in ways to regain it. Actions like boosting, drifting and also charging a jump will increase your air consumption a significant amount. Running out will force you to go on foot until you can recover Air with one of the methods covered below.

### Tricks

All stages in Riders feature trick ramps, visibly marked slopes that allow you to leap over a great distance. While you’re in the air, you can do tricks in a given direction by tilting the left stick. Unlike the trick system in modern mainline Sonic games like Generations or Frontiers, you actually have to consider the direction and timing of the trick, as you are once again ranked based on how well you did. The amount of tricks you can do is detemined by your speed during your jump and also how long you charged said jump by holding A/X.

</video>

This is the main method to replenish Air, you are guaranteed to encounter multiple big ramps in every lap and can go out of your way to make use of smaller ramps scattered throughout the track, should you need the extra Air. Depending on the ramp, holding forward or backward when jumping might even put you on a different path.

### Type Shortcuts
An interesting gameplay mechanic that Riders inherits from Sonic Heroes is the character type assignments - every playable character is of either a Speed, Flight, or Power type. This does have a general effect on their stats, like Flight characters having better acceleration at the cost of top speed, but their most important trait is the type-specific shortcuts they open up. All type shortcuts offer a way to replenish Air. Chaining multiple of these shortcut actions together gives you a chain bonus (labelled Link), effectively giving you more Air.

</video>

- Speed characters can grind on rails by pressing **A/X** in mid-air while being next to one. This passively replenishes Air while your character automatically moves along the rail. Some of them even have gaps in them - jumping from one part to another awards you a chain bonus. Some tracks were made by psychopaths and have bottomless pits under the rail gaps, which are a harsh punishment for missing a pretty janky jump.
- Flight characters can fly off of special ramps and through special mid-air flight rings. You can steer left/right as well as up/down with the left stick. Being in the flight state passively replenishes your Air, but if you don’t go through a ring for a few seconds you will start losing speed and eventually fall. The rings will generally keep you on the right path, allowing you to get back on the ground with a nice speed boost instead. Going through rings in quick succession awards you a chain bonus.
- Power characters can break special props and stage hazards, which awards you with Air. Their shortcuts typically involve just plowing through a bunch of breakables, with each prop broken in succession awarding you a chain bonus. While the shortcuts themselves seem like nothing special, the immunity to hazards is definitely worth considering on some tracks.

### Turbulence
This is Riders’ unique catch-up mechanic. Players moving very quickly will create a wind trail behind them, which can be ridden on by other racers. While on someone’s turbulence, you move forward automatically without consuming Air and can move side to side with the left stick to accelerate. Sometimes the edge of a turbulence can have a Trick Area on it, signaled by a red arrow. Doing a trick here speeds you up significantly and can sometimes even put you on a hidden path.

### Levelling Up
Like most other kart racers, Riders has you collecting a currency, in this case Rings, during the race. At 30 and 60 Rings respectively you Level Up, which **raises your top speed, max Air, boost speed and FULLY replenishes your Air tank**.

Boosting into other racers will cause you to attack them, dropping them down one level. Falling off of the track will reset your Ring count to ZERO, which makes some Speed shortcuts especially risky.

*Worth noting: the community mods which I cover later in this post remove the Ring punishment for falling off the track, as you already get placed BEFORE whatever pit you fell into which effectively puts you in last place.*

### Stage Gimmicks
Most tracks have some kind of gimmick that involves spinning the left stick to replenish Air and progress more quickly. A good example would be the crossbows on **Sand Ruins** - spinning the stick pulls the bow back further, which causes you to get shot farther and also replenish more Air.

If I remember correctly, the only stages where it’s possible to skip the stage gimmick are **Metal City** and **Night Chase**, which share their ending sequence with a Trick Ramp before a tower. Jumping the right way will put you on the tower’s upper area, which has another ramp instead of the gimmick.

## Non-gameplay stuff

Riders is a pretty unique title even outside of it’s convoluded gameplay. For one thing, it fixes a problem that the franchise has had for a long time - the character models are incredibly expressive! Think of the goofy faces characters would make in Sonic Adventure but done right. Weirdly enough, no other game has come remotely close to this level except one sequel to Riders, which I’ll cover later. Modern Sonic games fail to match this quality outside of pre-rendered cutscenes, though to give praise where it’s due - Sonic Frontiers does try to work around this a little, but at the end of the day they don’t change any of the design flaws with the character models that make it so hard to achieve expressive animations.

### The Babylon Rogues
![Babylon Rogues](<../../img/blog/riders/Babylon_Rogues.webp>)
<sub>From left to right: Jet the Hawk, Storm the Albatross and Wave the Swallow</sub>

These guys serve as Team Sonic’s rivals for this series. They are actually the first bird characters features in a Sonic game! This is not just a random choice - while Sonic is said to be the fastest on the ground, Jet is said to be the fastest in the air (i.e. on Extreme Gear), which makes for an interesting dynamic between the two where Sonic ISN’T the fastest for once and it also ties back into the Rouges' design. They are deliberately meant to contrast Team Sonic in their colors, personality and design. They are ready to be ruthless, collaborate with Eggman, all to further their own goals. Despite all this, at the end of the first Riders the relationship between Team Sonic and Team Babylon isn’t antagonistic and turns more into more of a friendly rivalry instead.

### Setting
Riders is much more futuristic than previous entries. Even core concepts like Extreme Gear are based on certain sci-fi tropes. The very first stage of the game is Metal City, whose description literally states “Race through future expressways”. Despite this, the story tries it’s best to mix the futuristic parts with historical elements: different ruins, Team Babylon’s heritage or even the Babylon Garden stage, which is a perfect mix of past and future: it’s a futuristic floating island built around Extreme Gear travel, decked with buildings inspired by the Byzantine Empire.

### Artwork, artstyle, sound design

The character artwork featured on Riders’ character select screen features some of the best artwork that the Sonic series has been blessed with. The exaggerated body proportions are on full display, even more so than in other games. The shadows in this artwork are uniquely stylized based on a character’s associated color. Most racers also have unique accesories and/or outfits to fit the skating theme.

The uniqueness of the artstyle isn’t limited to 2D artwork. The exaggerated proportions are seen in the 3D models for the characters. Unfortunately the developers didn’t try to replicate the unique shadows here, but that’s likely because a spin-off like this wouldn’t have the resources to implement cel-shading, especially since the technique was still relatively new.

Riders also has some pretty good sound design! As you race, Omochao serves as an announcer that comments on player's actions. Their voicelines tend to get burned into your memory, but in a good way! The music and sound effects help significantly in giving this game it's unique identity. Even the main menu music is a total bop and gets you super hyped up before you start a race!


## What went wrong?

As I said before, Riders came out at a very inopportune time for Sonic as a whole, but it’s biggest mistake was not teaching its players anything about all the mechanics that go into a race. Funnily enough there IS a tutorial in the game, but it’s hidden away in the EXTRAS section on the start screen, under… movies?

TODO: VIDEO
<sub>The “Tutorial” as shown ingame</sub>

That’s right, the game has a incredibly basic tutorial in the form of A FUCKING WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER VIDEO!!!! There are ZERO prompts telling you about its existence, you have to get curious yourself and decide to check out the extras section on a screen that you see for a grand total of a couple seconds before you go into the ACTUAL main menu for the game.

### Overall issues

- Turbulence can send you off the track, either because it stops suddenly or because it followed someone that went on certain flight ramps
- Turbulence can often prevent you from charging your jump which can often undo your progress when it comes to catching up
- Driving into a wall weirdly bounces you off of it
- Falling off of the stage returns you to 0 rings, which is devastating if you were level 3
- Falling off of the stage returns you to the point before you fell, instead of after. This makes it excessively punishing compared to other racing games
- Most if not all pickups from item boxes that aren’t rings or air are a straight up disadvantage (example: the speed boost pickup sets your speed to 200, which will lower your speed if you’re boosting)
- The arena battle mode isn’t very fun due to the game’s fast pacing and arena design
- The mission mode is comprised of a bunch of highly repetitive missions that will suck out your love for this game
- Half of the games stages, which are featured in the Babylon side of the story, are just remixes of the original tracks

## Weird story beats

- While it’s obvious that story isn’t going to be this game’s strong suit, in the story mode the game often pits you against 6 or 7 identical robots even though there are 16 playable characters
- The english voice acting sucks in cutscenes because the cast wasn’t given any context for the lines they had to read
- When Knuckles expresses his suspicion regarding Eggman’s actions and the tournament entry fee of 1 Chaos Emerald, he asks *“But what exactly is Eggman really after?”*, to which for some god forsaken reason Sonic replies with *“Aw, it can’t be anything too important”.* By this time Eggman has already been involved in **numerous world-threatening events** which Sonic had to fight off
- Tails prepares a replacement EX-Gear for Sonic in case something happens but doesn’t bother checking his old one, even though it has a bright red (SPOILER) on it which somehow NO ONE noticed

## Other misc issues and fun facts

- An ad included with the manual for the game claims that Sonic 06 will be released on Xbox 360 and PC instead of Xbox 360 and PS3
- Nintendo Power, an official Nintendo magazine, falsely claimed Mario to be a playable character exclusive to the GameCube release
- Omochao, the game’s announcer, sometimes misgenders characters whenever they successfully stick a landing (*”And she sticks a nice landing!”* for male characters and vice versa)
- The demo versions for the game not only show the stupid tutorial video I mentioned before, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE PROPER TUTORIAL POPUPS BEFORE YOU START YOUR FIRST RACE!!!!! These popups aren’t seen in ANY full release
- The PC version has multiple layering issues and inherits problems from the Xbox release. It breaks eye and mouth animations in story cutscenes and has some missing english gameplay voicelines. It also has no Exit Game option, you need to Alt+F4 out of it if you're in Fullscreen mode
